To install this, just clone the repo and follow this simple tutorial: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/extension-sideloading.

The extension just has a textarea where you can write the pages you want blocked following a few rules. This is a copy from the extension itself so that you can see how far it goes: ```How blocking works:
Base domains (reddit.com) → blocks ALL of Reddit including old.reddit.com, www.reddit.com, etc.
Subdomains (old.reddit.com) → blocks ONLY old Reddit, not main Reddit
Paths (youtube.com/watch) → blocks only YouTube videos, not homepage
Subdomain paths (old.reddit.com/gallery) → blocks only old Reddit galleries```

It's privacy-oriented, so it uses no permissions and doesn't read your pages or URLs at all. You can verify this by just looking at this code.
